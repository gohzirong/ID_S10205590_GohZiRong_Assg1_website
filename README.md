This website is a personal portfolio which consists of information about me such as my future aspirations, my past education and my leadership roles.

Design Process:

The website is directed towards employers to encourage them to consider me as a suitable employee and an asset towards the company. As the information on the website is mainly on my acheivements and my future goals, employers would be able to understand my goal and that i have the relevant requirements for the job.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As an employer, I want to be able to contanct the person, so that I can know more about this person or call said person in for an interview.

Features
The website has a Linkedin Link where it allows employers to view the linkedin profile if needed.
There is also a form function if employers would rather use the form function.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears (done)
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears (done)
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears. (done)
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

Media
The photos used in this site were obtained from Google
