                    <p>
                        Hi my name is Goh Zi Rong. I am currently a student in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, School of Infocomm Technology
                        , pursuing a Diploma in Information Technology. I am an avid learner who strives to constantly upgrade myself 
                        to be up to date within the IT workforce. I have participated in the planning and organizing or several events 
                        which has thus improved my adaptability, teamwork and critical thinking skills.

            <h2 id="headings">Inspirations and Aspirations</h2>
            
            <h3>Why IT?</h3>
            <p>
                I am interested in the world of Information Technology hence my reason for pursuing a job that related to the field. 
                One reason why I have decided to pursue a Diploma in Information Technology and not any other Infocomm Technology 
                courses provided by Ngee Ann Polytechnic is due to my lack of knowledge of Infocomm. Hence, by choosing a non-niche 
                diploma, this would enable me to experience the numerous sectors that are in the world of Information Technology.
            </p>

            <h3>My Future Plan</h3>
            <p>
                After learning the general idea of what IT is in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, I have decided that upon graduation, I would firstly complete my National Service
                before I continue my studies. In terms of university, I would have to decide on whether I would prefer continuing my studies in an overseas or local university. 
                If I were to decide on studying overseas, I would apply to study at Macquarie University in Australia where I can achieve a degree in Software 
                Development or Computer Science. However, if I were to decide on studying at a local university, my choice would be the National University 
                of Singapore. The National University of Singapore currently offers two degrees that I am interested in, the first being Computer Science 
                and the second being a degree in Information System.
